      We are **librarians, curators, archivists, cataloguers, researchers, software engineers,
      marketers, finance & HR professionals and others** working in **galleries, libraries,
      archives and museums** (the GLAM sector).
      We help each other and others to
      **develop confidence, understanding and skills in statistics and data science**
      to make the most of data,
      improve decision making
      and ensure data is used ethically in the Cultural Heritage sector.
