## Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't have been possible without the support and inspiration of a large number of people and groups.

### Support

[Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/)
: Enabled this project to get off the ground through their [Fellowship Programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme), providing training, a network, moral support and a small amount of funding. [Jez Cope](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/jez-cope) was awarded an SSI Fellowship as part of the 2020 inauguration.

### Inspiration & prior art

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
: An inspiring example of a successful and inclusive community built around teaching essential programming & data skills to researchers (and, more recently, librarians), championing the development of teaching skills. Particularly notable for its robust and forward-thinking approach to equality, diversity and inclusion.

[Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org/)
: An offshoot of the Mozilla Open Leadership programme aiming to help "individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors".

[Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)
: An initiative to "publish novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching", the Programming Historian provides a wide range of peer-reviewed self-study lessons on a range of programming- and data-related topics. It's driven and maintained by a huge community of volunteers.

[Alan Turing Institute Humanities & Data Science interest group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/humanities-and-data-science)
: A small group that has been meeting regularly (first face-to-face and then via video conference) to discuss data science topics of interest in the Humanities.

[GLAM Labs community](https://glamlabs.io/)
: Brings together innovative "Labs" teams in galleries, libraries, archives & museums around the world to share experience of experimentation in the sector.
