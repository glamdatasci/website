# Project background

In January 2020 [Jez Cope was awarded a Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship][fellowship], to kickstart a cultural heritage data science network at the British Library. I plan to work as openly as possible on this project, and this repository is home to plans, reports and other documents related to the work.
