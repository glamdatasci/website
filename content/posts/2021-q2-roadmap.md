The big thing that's been missing from this site so far is an overview of what I'd like the next few months to look like, so this post is an attempt to fix that! Right now we're in the "Launch" phase below, but after that it will be time to plough ahead, run some events and really start to figure out how to make this work for everyone.

**Don't forget, [we need help to get this thing off the ground!]({{< ref "help-needed-launch-workshop.md" >}})**

## üöÄ Launch: March ‚Äì June (Q1‚Äì2)

Focus
: Brainstorm ideas; plan activities; build a core team

Activities
: - Encourage people to join communication channels (mailing list, chat room) and discuss their own needs & ideas
  - Run small planning sessions/discussions to plan launch workshop
  - Run public launch workshop: gather input from current and potential community members about needs/wants, barriers, and ways to address those
  - Brainstorming session as part of IDCC Unconference
  - Develop online presence & promote network as opportunities arise
  
Outcomes
: - Shared vision of the community, developed by the community
  - Flexible programme of activities for Q3‚Äì4 sketched out
  - First 1‚Äì2 activities scheduled and planned for July/August
  - Good growth in engagement with mailing list, chat room & GitHub
