I (Jez) have a couple of posts on my own blog that relate to plans for this community that I'd like to include by reference.

One is a [short reflection on my own motivations and goals for starting this community][what I want]. Of course, these goals will be updated and extended as more people join in, but they at least provide a starting point.

The other is [a post acknowledging some of the other work that's inspired this network][fellow travellers]. Not necessarily exhaustive (it can't be) but probably the basis for a resources page on this site.
