Ok, I've tweeted and tooted, I've set up a website, I've had advice and guidance from some amazing people, but there's something I need to do before we can go any further: I need to ask for help.

See, the original project plan, pre-COVID, was to start with a small internal network within the British Library before starting to grow it externally. Once the pandemic arrived and made us all much more used to communicating and taking part remotely as well as face-to-face, it made sense to expand that earlier, since a larger network can reach a sustainable critical mass sooner. However, this does require a bit more time & energy up front and I have to admit that's not something I can do on my own.

So, **here's what I'm asking for**:

1. Some help planning and facilitating a **launch workshop** 
    - 1â€“2 hours brainstorming logistics, a format and an agenda that will gather input
    - Help drafting, proof-reading and disseminating comms about the workshop
    - Support during the event to make notes, share facilitation, wrangle technology and generally make everyone feel welcome and able to contribute
2. As many people as possible to attend said launch workshop and help shape the early development of the community
3. Enthusiastic people to attend events that we run, join in discussions, promote events and activities, suggest activities and volunteer to facilitate them, and generally help to steer the community as it gets going

In return, you'll get to **join and shape a community** that will help you and others develop confidence, understanding and skills in statistics and data science. We want everyone to be able to make the most of data, improve decision making and ensure data is used ethically in the Cultural Heritage sector.

If this community is something you'd like to see happen and you're willing to offer even a tiny bit of time to make success more likely, please get in touch! You can:
