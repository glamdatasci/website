Well, it's a bit later than planned, but here is a summary of our November meeting, held on Monday 8th. We had a fairly broad ranging discussion about resources for developing coding skills, and about other groups & networks we might link up with. I've summarised the links and resources below.

## Follow-up

-   Collect and collate information from members about
    -   Current knowledge and confidence levels
    -   What problems we would like to solve in our work
    -   What resources we know about and would like to share
-   Encourage people to share these on a regular basis in the chat room to allow others to offer suggestions
