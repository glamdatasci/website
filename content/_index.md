We are **librarians, curators, archivists, cataloguers, researchers, software engineers, marketers, finance & HR professionals and others** working in the field of cultural heritage.

We help each other and others to **develop confidence, understanding and skills in statistics and data science** to make the most of data, improve decision making and ensure data is used ethically in the Cultural Heritage sector.
