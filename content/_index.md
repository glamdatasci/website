*This project is in its early stages, but you're welcome to take a look around, or get in touch by [opening a new issue][new issue] on our [GitHub page][].*

We are **librarians, curators, archivists, cataloguers, researchers, software engineers, marketers, finance & HR professionals and others** working in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) & Cultural Heritage sector.

We help each other and others to **develop confidence, understanding and skills in statistics and data science** to make the most of data, improve decision making and ensure data is used ethically in the Cultural Heritage sector.

Sound interesting? **You're one of us too!**
