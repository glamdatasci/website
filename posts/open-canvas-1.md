### Problem

Data analysis in non-technical organisations is a lonely business: it’s hard to network, learn about good practice and develop as a professional, which makes it hard to stay excited and motivated.

Cultural Heritage “data” sources and techniques are much richer and more diverse than many data science professionals are used to, and have unique challenges

### Solution

Build a network that offers opportunities to talk to and learn form others across departmental and organisational boundaries.

### Unique Value Proposition
