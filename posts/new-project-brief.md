## Introduction

This document is intended to provide a 2-page summary of the project to give someone a quick overview.

### Motivation: why are we doing this?

Cultural heritage work, like all knowledge work, is increasingly data-based,
or at least gives opportunities to make use of data day-to-day.
The proper skills to use this data enable more effective working.
Knowledge and experience thus gained improves understanding of and empathy with users also using such skills.

There are now excellent training opportunities available to novices
who wish to make better skills
(see [§ Prior art](#prior-art) below).
However, without support from peers and more experienced colleagues,
it can be difficult to 

### Prior art

The British Library's [Digital Scholarship Staff Training Programme][] provides
formal taught workshops and seminars,
along with informal group learning sessions
and a Digital Scholarship reading group.
The [Programming Historian][] offers
"novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials
that help humanists learn a wide range of
digital tools, techniques, and workflows
to facilitate research and teaching",
in English, Spanish and French.
[Library Carpentry][],
with the other communities under the [Carpentries umbrella][],
provides open lesson materials
and a structured teacher training & certification programme

## Goals

This project is intended to change the working practices of people in Cultural Heritage (CH) organisations in two ways:

1.  Make more and better use of data in their own operational work
2.  Have a better understanding of the ways our users make use of CH data, to better plan and deliver services

### Assumptions

We assume that:

- Data skills are accessible to all given time and the right support
- Time, motivation and confidence are the key barriers to adoption
- Peer support is more sustainable for intermediate learners
  than formal training on its own
  (which is still ideal and necessary for novices)

### Problems to overcome

- 

### Success/impact measures



We will measure this by:

- Surveying participants on measures of both goals at start and end of project
- Conducting pulse surveys throughout to check for needed course corrections
- Collecting 3-4 case studies of specific impacts

## Budget

Up to £3,000 is available to support this work through
the [SSI Fellowship programme][].
As well as funding development opportunities for the Fellow,
it is anticipated that this may include:

- Provision of suitable communications channels for the project,
  such as web hosting ([Netlify][], [GitHub][])
- Infrastructure for teaching (e.g. cloud resources)
- Professional design work
- Small promotional items,
  such as stickers,
  to increase members' sense of belonging
- Prizes for competitions
- Speaker fees/honorariums?

## Stakeholders

- British Library staff as potential network members
- External speakers

## Strategy

We will work towards the two goals stated above by:

- Show (don't tell!) people what is possible and relevant to their work
- Develop transferrable skills of question-asking and computational problem-solving
- Situate those skills in context(s) relevant to the learner
- Break down language barriers between data scientists and others
- Create online and offline safe spaces to admit knowledge gaps, ask questions and learn from peers
